# Overview
## The keywords

`.await`, per the `IntoFuture` trait (but, notably, *not* [the Keyword `await` page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/keyword.await.html)!):

> The `.await` keyword desugars into a call to `IntoFuture::into_future` first before polling the future to completion. `IntoFuture` is implemented for all `T: Future` which means the `into_future` method will be available on all futures.

This means you can always call `.await` on any type which implements `Future`, but *also* on any type which implements `IntoFuture`. Thus, e.g., [[Tokio|Tokio]]’s [`JoinHandle`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.JoinHandle.html) (its implementation of an `async` version of [`std::thread::JoinHandle`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html)) has an `impl Future`, so you can directly `.await` it as a result of the desuraging.

## Mental model

What is the Rust equivalent to this?

```ts
function main() {
  hello().then(
    (value) => {
      console.log(value);
    },
    (error) => {
      console.error(error);
    }
  );
}

async function hello(): String {
  return "Hello, world!";
}
```

The short answer is: there is nothing *exactly* equivalent to it, because there is no built-in executor. The main executor people use is Tokio, of course; there are also:

The closest thing in Rust to the above is going to be something like this (with `futures` in `Cargo.toml`):

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = futures::executor::block_on(hello());
    println!("{result}");
}

async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}
```

It *does* feel weird not to have a “good default” baked in, and given the prominence of `futures`, it is *doubly* weird to me not to just ship that executor… but I can imagine the bike-shedding that proposing as much would produce. 🥴 Basically every executor out there ends up shipping ~`block_on` because its utility is so high, AFAICT.

Cliff Biffle [asserts](https://cliffle.com/blog/async-inversion/) (I think accurately!) that async in Rust is two key things, brought together in a powerful way:

- “an inversion of control”, where the caller gets control over the flow of the body of the async function
- a way of building state machines which are much less error prone because they are *not* managed by hand

## Notable runtimes

- [tokio](https://tokio.rs)
- [smol](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol)
- [futures](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/) (this is complicated! `tokio` depends directly on `futures`, while `smol` uses a small 😑 subset of it called `futures-lite`)

## Questions

What is the relationship between the [futures](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/) crate and `std::future`? (And why the deuce is that not clearly documented in the docs for both?!?)

- It looks like the core traits were pulled over at 1.36.0, when it was stabilized, but the `futures` crate has a ton of other capabilities in it, e.g. its own executor.
- The answer is [found](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/03_state_of_async_rust.html#language-and-library-support) in the Async book:
> - The most fundamental traits, types and functions, such as the [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html) trait are provided by the standard library.
> - The `async/await` syntax is supported directly by the Rust compiler.
> - Many utility types, macros and functions are provided by the [`futures`](https://docs.rs/futures/) crate. They can be used in any async Rust application.


## Cancelation

Thinking about this pair of comments from [[Tokio|Tokio]]’s docs for `JoinHandle`:

> The `&mut JoinHandle<T>` type is cancel safe. If it is used as the event in a `tokio::select!` statement and some other branch completes first, then it is guaranteed that the output of the task is not lost.
> 
> If a `JoinHandle` is dropped, then the task continues running in the background and its return value is lost.

This is an important distinction. The behavior of the task when *dropped* is the same as it is for `std::thread::JoinHandle`, *and* it is safe for cancellation. Cancellation is a distinct concept from `Drop`. Cancellation is sometimes implicit, e.g. the result of joining a couple tasks and accepting the first one to finish (e.g. `tokio::select!(future_a, future_b).

On the one hand, it is to the community’s credit that there is detailed documentation of cancellation safety (e.g. in [the `tokio::select!` documentation](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/macro.select.html)). On the other hand, it seems like a fairly obvious footgun! It is also not 100% obvious to me whether “cancellation safety” _per se_ is actually rigorously defined. These seem fairly different, for example (_ibid._):

> The following methods are not cancellation safe and can lead to loss of data:
> 
> - [`tokio::io::AsyncReadExt::read_exact`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/trait.AsyncReadExt.html#method.read_exact "method tokio::io::AsyncReadExt::read_exact")
> - [`tokio::io::AsyncReadExt::read_to_end`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/trait.AsyncReadExt.html#method.read_to_end "method tokio::io::AsyncReadExt::read_to_end")
> - [`tokio::io::AsyncReadExt::read_to_string`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/trait.AsyncReadExt.html#method.read_to_string "method tokio::io::AsyncReadExt::read_to_string")
> - [`tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt::write_all`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWriteExt.html#method.write_all "method tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt::write_all")
> 
> The following methods are not cancellation safe because they use a queue for fairness and cancellation makes you lose your place in the queue:
> 
> - [`tokio::sync::Mutex::lock`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html#method.lock "method tokio::sync::Mutex::lock")
> - [`tokio::sync::RwLock::read`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html#method.read "method tokio::sync::RwLock::read")
> - [`tokio::sync::RwLock::write`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html#method.write "method tokio::sync::RwLock::write")
> - [`tokio::sync::Semaphore::acquire`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Semaphore.html#method.acquire "method tokio::sync::Semaphore::acquire")
> - [`tokio::sync::Notify::notified`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Notify.html#method.notified "method tokio::sync::Notify::notified")

Tokio’s doc continues:

> Cancellation safety can be defined in the following way: If you have a future that has not yet completed, then it must be a no-op to drop that future and recreate it. This definition is motivated by the situation where a `select!` is used in a loop. Without this guarantee, you would lose your progress when another branch completes and you restart the `select!` by going around the loop.
> 
> Be aware that cancelling something that is not cancellation safe is not necessarily wrong. For example, if you are cancelling a task because the application is shutting down, then you probably don’t care that partially read data is lost.

This is sort of adjacent to idempotency—but not identical, because of the caveat around completion.

## Misc.

- There is no `Debug` implementation for the anonymous `Future` created by `async fn`, which makes sense: it is not the case that `Future: Debug`, and `Future` is a trait, and `async fn foo() -> T` is *roughly* like `fn foo() -> impl Future<Output = T>`.
- Every `Future` you interact with has a concrete struct or enum backing it. This *should* be obvious but, weirdly, was not obvious to me.
    - Most of the time, you are not interacting directly with them.
    - Analogy for my own brain: this is kind of like `View` in SwiftUI: you *often* create a new `View` implementation which is a concrete `struct` there. It is *not* like `Promise` in JS, which while technically an interface *and* a class, is almost always done via the built-in `Promise` class.
    - How often do you explicitly create `Future`s yourself in Rust?
        - Probably depends on whether you’re an app author or a library author!
- Executors can and do distinguish whether they are multi-threaded or single-threaded.
    - The `futures::executor` module provides `LocalPool` as an explicit control for this, and `block_on` uses it by default, but also provides a `ThreadPool`; and both `LocalPool` and `ThreadPool` provide an implementation of `futures::task::Spawn`.
    - Likewise, `smol`’s `async_executor` ships [`Executor`](https://docs.rs/async-executor/1.8.0/async_executor/struct.Executor.html) and [`LocalExecutor`](https://docs.rs/async-executor/1.8.0/async_executor/struct.LocalExecutor.html) so users can choose.
- `futures` provides equivalents to some key sync APIs from `std`: `AsyncBufRead`, `AsyncRead`, `AsyncSeek`, `AsyncWrite` (cf. [`std::io::BufRead`](), [`std::io::Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/io/trait.Read.html), [`std::io::Seek`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/io/trait.Seek.html), [`std::io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.76.0/std/io/trait.Write.html))

## Lifetimes

Since `async { }` produces an anonymous `Future` type, a lot of the same dynamics as with closures appear. The ownership and lifetime dynamics are mostly invisible/implicit, but just like “closure captures” are ultimately a struct, potentially with borrowed data and therefore lifetime management, the same goes for `async` blocks.

For a value captured by a closure, if it is stack-local but you try to push it into heap-allocated data (`Box::new(|| &v)` or likewise with `Arc` etc.), you have to use a `move` closure instead. The same thing goes for an async block!
