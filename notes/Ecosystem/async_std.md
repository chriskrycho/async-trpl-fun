> `async-std`Â is a foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for theÂ [broader Rust ecosystem](https://crates.io/). It offers std types, likeÂ [`Future`](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/future/trait.Future.html)Â andÂ [`Stream`](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/stream/trait.Stream.html), library-definedÂ [operations on language primitives](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/index.html#primitives),Â [standard macros](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/index.html#macros),Â [I/O](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/io/index.html)Â andÂ [multithreading](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/task/index.html), amongÂ [many other things](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/index.html#what-is-in-the-standard-library-documentation).

## Stability/etc.

- Hasnâ€™t been released in close to two years.
- CI is currently failing. ðŸ˜¬

## Relationship to rest of ecosystem

- supports `futures` crate
- aims to provide same API as `std` itself
- similar in this regard to both [[Ecosystem/smol|smol]] and [[Ecosystem/Tokio|Tokio]]
- shares a bunch of the underlying crates with smol
